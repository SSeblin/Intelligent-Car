# Intelligent-Car
I am building a car that will automatically avoid obstacles. The movement is controlled by a L293D shield.

At this point, I have prototyped the movement of the robot: move forward, backward, turn right, left and stop. 

Next step: Make it stops in front of an obstacle and move forward when obstacle is removed.
